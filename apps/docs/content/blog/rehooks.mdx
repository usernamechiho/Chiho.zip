# Getting Started

Exploring a new approach to managing and distributing React hooks through a CLI-first experience that prioritizes developer workflow and codebase integration.

## The Problem with Traditional Hook Libraries

Traditional hook libraries bundle all their hooks together, leading to several challenges:

- Increased bundle size from unused hooks
- Limited flexibility in customization
- Version management across multiple projects
- Tight coupling with the library's implementation

## Introducing Rehooks: Hook Distribution Reimagined

Rehooks takes a fundamentally different approach by providing a CLI tool that directly injects production-ready hooks into your codebase. This brings several key advantages:

- **Zero Bundle Size Impact:** Only the hooks you select get added to your codebase
- **Full Type Safety:** Hooks are written in TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions
- **Complete Customization:** Since hooks are added to your codebase, you can modify them to fit your needs
- **SOLID Principles:** Each hook follows SOLID design principles for maximum reusability

I was looking for a way to streamline the process of creating custom hooks, and unfortunately, the dependecy wasn't the correct way, because I had to deal with the `limitation`, `bundle size`, `performance`, and `maintenance` issues. So I decided to create Rehooks to solve these problems.

## How It Works

1. **Project Initialization:** Generate a configuration file that tells Rehooks where to inject hooks
2. **Hook Collection:** Hooks are maintained in a dedicated directory with full TypeScript support
3. **Rust-Powered Processing:** A Rust script processes the hooks directory into a structured JSON API
4. **Smart CLI:** The CLI tool fetches available hooks from the API and handles the injection process
5. **Multiple Selection:** Developers can select and install multiple hooks in one go

## Technical Implementation

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Core:** Collection of the hooks
2. **Importer:** Converts hook implementations into a queryable JSON API
3. **Checker:** A rust-based checker for hook health
4. **CLI:** Provides the interface for hook selection and installation
5. **Docs:** Comprehensive documentation for Rehooks

## Benefits for Development Teams

- **Consistency:** Standardized hook implementations across projects
- **Maintainability:** Hooks become part of your codebase's version control
- **Flexibility:** Easy customization for project-specific needs
- **Performance:** No impact on bundle size from unused hooks

## Future Plans

- Community contributions for new hooks
- Hook testing templates
- Automated hook updates
- VSCode extension for hook management

## Conclusion

Rehooks represents a shift in how we think about code reuse in React applications. By moving from bundled libraries to a CLI-first approach, we gain more control, better performance, and improved maintainability without sacrificing the convenience of pre-built solutions. The initialization-first approach ensures that hooks are always installed in the right place and configured correctly for your project's needs.
