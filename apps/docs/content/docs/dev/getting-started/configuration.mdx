# Configuration

By using `init` command, which initializes the configuration file and generates the `rehooks.json` file, you can customize the configuration of Rehooks.

## Usage

```bash title="Terminal"
npx rehooks-cli@latest init
```

## Configuration

The `rehooks.json` file, includes a `directory` and `overwrite` property.

### Directory

The `directory` property specifies the directory where the hooks will be imported. By default, it is set to `src/hooks`.

### forceOverwrite

The `forceOverwrite` property specifies whether to overwrite existing hook files without prompt. By default, it is set to `false`.

<Callout type="warn">
  If you want to use a custom path for the hooks directory, you can pass it as
  an argument to the `init` command.
</Callout>

## Example

```json title="rehooks.json"
{
  "directory": "src/hooks",
  "forceOverwrite": false
}
```
