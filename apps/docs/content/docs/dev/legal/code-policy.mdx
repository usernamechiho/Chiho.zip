## 2. Code Standards

To maintain consistency and quality across the Project, the following standards must be adhered to:

## 3. Contribution Guidelines

- **Pull Requests:** Ensure all pull requests are thoroughly tested and include clear descriptions of the changes.
- **Testing:** Contributions must include tests for new features or fixes where applicable.
- **Commit Messages:** Use meaningful commit messages. Follow this structure:
  - Use \`feat\`, \`fix\`, \`perf\`, or similar prefixes for commits.
  - Examples: \`perf: optimize hook health checker\`, \`feat: add version compatibility checker\`.

## 4. Security and Dependencies

- **Dependencies:** Only approved libraries and tools may be added to the Project. All dependencies must be lightweight and actively maintained.
