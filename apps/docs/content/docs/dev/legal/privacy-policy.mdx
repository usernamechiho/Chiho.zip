**Last Updated:** January 2025

Rehooks ("we", "our", or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Rehooks CLI project (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

Rehooks does not collect, store, or process any personal information from its users. The Service operates locally on your device and does not transmit data to any external servers, except when explicitly configured to interact with external APIs.

## 2. Use of Third-Party APIs or Integrations

If the Service interacts with third-party APIs or services (e.g., for hook imports or updates), any data exchanged is handled directly by those third parties. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party services you use with Rehooks to understand their practices.

## 3. Local Storage

The Service may create and manage local configuration files (e.g., \`rehooks.json\`) on your system to facilitate its functionality. These files remain on your local device and are not transmitted to any external systems by default.

## 4. Data Security

While Rehooks does not process personal data, we prioritize the security of your local files. However, we are not responsible for any breaches or vulnerabilities caused by misuse or third-party tools that you integrate with the Service.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Service or applicable laws. Any updates will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Service after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.

## 6. Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact [Mehdi](https://x.com/Pyr33x) at [contact@pyr33x.ir](mailto:contact@pyr33x.ir).
